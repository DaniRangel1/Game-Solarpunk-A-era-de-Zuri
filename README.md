## 2. PROJECT SCOPE

### General Description
The game takes place across six interconnected continents, each with distinct ecosystems, cultures, and technologies.  

Players freely explore these regions, solve environmental challenges, and face colossal robotic Guardians — entities that preserve vital memories about Earth’s downfall and rebirth.  

The experience blends **immersive storytelling**, **reflective themes**, and **artistic expression**, exploring sustainability, technological ethics, and human empathy.  
The visual style draws inspiration from the **Solarpunk movement**, accompanied by a haunting, atmospheric soundtrack.

## 3. GAMEPLAY

### Core Mechanics
- Free exploration in an open, interconnected world  
- Global train system (*Treem*) as main transportation  
- Large-scale battles against mechanical colossi  
- Environmental puzzle-solving  
- Interaction with NPCs and moral decision-making  
- Progression system based on recovered “memory fragments”

### Combat Systems
Zuri uses three main combat tools:

- **Robot A (Defense):** Generates shields and absorbs damage  
- **Robot B (Strength):** Performs melee attacks and destroys obstacles  
- **Nanotech Glove:** Multifunctional weapon that can transform into a sword, shield, hook, energy cannon, or hacking device  

Players can dynamically switch between combat modes and use the environment tactically.

## 4. LEVEL DESIGN

### Level 1 – Futuristic Rio de Janeiro  
Zuri begins his journey in a sustainable, vertical-green version of Rio.  
**Goal:** Gather tech parts to hack and upgrade his home robots, “Mother” and “Father.”  
This serves as a **tutorial** for movement, parkour, and basic interactions.

### Level 2 – The Intercontinental Train (*Treem*)  
Powered by oceanic energy, the Treem connects all continents.  
During a trip, a system failure gives the player 5 real-time minutes to investigate and interact with NPCs, introducing **dialogue and clue mechanics**.

### Level 3 – The Mysterious Scientist  
Zuri meets **Vargas**, who claims to know his parents.  
He reveals that an AI called *Mother of the World* hides the truth about them.  
Zuri must choose to:
- **Trust Vargas:** Continue to the next continent  
- **Doubt Vargas:** Unlock new dialogue options in the previous area  

### Level 4 – The Amazon Continent  
A ruined, polluted Amazon.  
Zuri builds a purifier and faces a **tree-like colossus**.  
Recovered memory: the start of the nuclear war and human greed.  

### Level 5 – North America  
A desert wasteland of vertical farms.  
Zuri repairs agricultural drones and faces a **metallic sandworm colossus**.  
Recovered memory: creation of defense barriers and global arms race.  

### Level 6 – Europe  
Ruined cities submerged in fog.  
Zuri faces a **metallic bullet-shaped colossus**, aided by his robots.  
Recovered memory: a man trying to destroy the nuclear barrier to stop the war.  

### Level 7 – South Africa  
Frozen floating city.  
Zuri reactivates the **Solar Furnace** and faces a **lion-eagle-serpent hybrid Guardian**.  
Recovered memory: the barrier was destroyed, but too late to stop the apocalypse.  

### Level 8 – Oceania  
A collapsing underwater city.  
Zuri collects components to restore oxygen balance and faces a **mechanical whale Guardian**.  
Recovered memory: early efforts to rebuild sustainable society.  

### Level 9 – Asia  
Metropolis ruled by rebellious AI.  
Zuri learns Vargas has manipulated him into destroying the planet’s balance.  
He meets **Mother Earth**, the last AI, who reveals the truth about his parents.  

### Level 10 – Final Confrontation  
Zuri faces Vargas in a symbolic digital chess duel, followed by a physical battle.  
If victorious, Zuri restores Mother Earth and begins a new era of harmony.
